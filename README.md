# The Renamer
Batch renamer script written in Shell. Purely for internal use within Cole Haan, LLC. Local copy works if existing in same folder as images, and the remote application is in-progress.
I coded this using Bash because I just wanted to see if it would work, but since I know now that it does, I'm working on a simple application that can be double-clicked, search for the folder and do the process automatically.
